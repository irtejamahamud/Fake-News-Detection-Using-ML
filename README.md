# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

![Fake News Detection Banner](./previewFnews)

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to detect **fake news articles** using supervised machine learning algorithms. It classifies news content as *real* or *fake* based on textual features extracted from the dataset. The project is built with Python, utilizes scikit-learn models, and applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze the text data.

## ✅ Features

- Preprocessing of raw news data (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal)
- Text vectorization using **TF-IDF**
- Classification using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Passive Aggressive Classifier
- Model performance evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
- Interactive command-line interface

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine**
- **Naive Bayes**

These models are trained on labeled news data and used to predict whether new/unseen news articles are fake or real.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
